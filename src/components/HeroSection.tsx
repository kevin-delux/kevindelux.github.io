                My interest in biomedical, particularly cancer-related research stems from a personal battle with childhood cancer. 
                During my 14th birthday, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgekin's Lymphoma, which had metastasized to multiple lymph nodes, my chest, some bones and my legs.
                I underwent intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which not only saved my life but also ignited a deep passion for understanding disease mechanisms and improving patient outcomes.
                That unfortunate but character-building experience is what drove me to pursuing a degree in Medical Sciences, with the hope of contributing to advancements in cancer research and treatment.
                I believe that I will greatly contribute to the scientific community and improve or even save the lives of those who need help the most, just like me only a couple years ago.
